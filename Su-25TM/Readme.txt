Choose between default Su-25T or Su-27 avionics.
With Su-25T avionics you basically get the same default Su-25T.
Su-27 avionics allows to use KH-31P and R-77 missile with Kopyo radar pod. However, laser designator/TV is no longer available. In order to launch KH-31P use LAlt+W (Launch override) when in proximity to enemy ship.
KH-31A/KH35 anti ship missiles do not work as there's no air-to-ground radar in default Su-25T or in any FC3 planes.
