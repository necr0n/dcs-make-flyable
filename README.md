# dcs-make-flyable
All AI aircraft made flyable as mods using already available flight models and cockpits. WIP

# What's this about?
Many individual mods exist out there for DCS for individual aircraft (Su-34, Su-35, B-1B, etc.) Not all of them are updated for actual DCS version (2.5+). There are basically two options for mods:
- passing the integrity check and flying with weapons that don't work if they're not supported by the SFM/AFM
- creating a plane with a new name that doesn't exist in the default DCS library (what VSN team is doing)

The goal of this project is to add all AI aircraft as flyable and with selectable cockpits (Su-25T/FC3/Viggen/Ka50 etc.) passing the integrity check. Even just to taxi/take off. There's no point in having 10 people making same AI mods, time would be better spent on:
- modifying SFM for AI aircraft to feel more realistic
- developing air-to-ground radar
- enabling all the weapons available

# How to use it?
* Click on the green Clone or download button, download .ZIP

* Go to your user \Saved Games\DCS\Mods\aircraft folder (for example C:\Users\your_username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\aircraft). If you don't have that folder, create it.

* Unzip archive content inside "aircraft" folder.

* Run ps.bat installer script

# Why should I run some .bat file? I'm more comfortable running an .exe installer
There's benefit in a .bat file - it's open source, you can take a look inside and see what it does. Antivirus scanners will ensure that it contains no viruses.
