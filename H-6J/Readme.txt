Su-25T avionics and cockpit.
Only bombs work, missiles are not supported.

Use PlaneJettisonFuelTanks command (default LAlt + R) to open or close the bomb bay.
There's no collision on it, so bombs fall through even if it's closed.

TV defaults to a center mount and doesn't provide a good line of sight. It can't be changed.
